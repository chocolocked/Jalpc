Went from "what I'm doing here even" in front of a boat 2 weeks ago to taking my friend A out for sailing yesterday. Though too much wind, in too much danger of capsizing, we had a good time. Yellow and Red ratings, here I come :) 

A and I took a looong walk (to calm our slightly frightened hearts) along the esplanade and shared a drink under the late afternoon sun. We shared our opinions of how humans connect with each other in mysterious ways, how people make friends, and how people establish romantic relationships. Different people always want different things: some people might get married just for the sake of getting married and having kids. But there are always some people who want to spend the rest of their lives with that special someone whom they're really connected with (ðŸ™ƒ) -- and that's always hard but there is always hope, and we need to stay true to what we want deep down. 

It was a lovely evening. I hope I can still remember it many years from now.
