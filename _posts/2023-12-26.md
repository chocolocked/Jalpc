Sometimes I wonder how I will be rememebered when I'm gone, and who will remember me when I'm gone?
And it makes me sad.

Sometimes it feels lonely even when you're surrounded by people.

Human hearts are mysteries of mysteries, but maybe that's waht makes us beautiful and vulnerable. 

I'll remember this Christmas Eve.
