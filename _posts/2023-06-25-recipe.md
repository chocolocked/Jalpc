Just note this down since it's kinda great 

**Dough** 
1. 2.5 cups all-purpose + 0.5 cup cake 
2. 7g of yeast (1 packet) or 22g of fresh yeast (activate it by breaking it down and dissolve in lukewarm milk
3. 0.75 cup of lukewarm milk (microwave for 30s)
4. 0.33 cup of brown sugar
5. 1 (.15) tbsp of cardamon
6. 75g butter
7. 1 egg
8. 1 tsp sea salt


Instructions 
a. flour
b. whisk together lukewarm milk, sugar, cardamon and egg + yeast 
c. add b) to a) and mix, add butter, mix for 10min before adding salt 
d. looking for the state where it's still a bit sticky and very spreadable ( too much flour or overworking will cause the rolls to become dense (ðŸ¥¹))
e. 1 hour of proofing (double in size) with a bunch of air holes (puffy!)
