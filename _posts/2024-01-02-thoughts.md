It's been a year with lots of unexpected things. I guess adult life is never easy. 

Broke some heart, got my heart broken. Met lots of interesting people, said goodbye to others.
Worked my ass off, and got a huuuuge bonus. 
There were times when I was so overwhelmed that I felt the whole world was crumbling down and I could not take it any longer, but thankfully, my people (and my therapist) were all there.

In the end, I'm still dreaming and hoping. What could be better than that?

==================================================================

I don't know why but random thoughts of death popped into my head pretty often these days. I'm perfectly fine I don't want to die, but also I keep wondering what kind of memories I will leave behind when I die? What do I want to be remembered for? I guess that's what I need to find out and live up to. New year's resolution? Done.

It's time to let go of things. Surprisingly, I feel calm about it. Mutta ajattelen sinua koko ajan, so you'll never be alone. 
From HIMYM -- “We’re going to get older, whether we like it or not, so the only question is whether we get on with our lives or desperately cling to the past.” 
I chose to look ahead, maybe I'm already on my way to discovering something new.
