It's been a year with lots of unexpected things. I guess adult life is never easy. 

Broke the heart, got my heart broken. Met lots of interesting people, said goodbye to others.

Worked my axx off, and got a huuuuge bonus. 

There were times when i was so overwhelmed that I felt the whole world was crumbling down and I could not take any longer, but thankfully, my people (and my therapist) were all there.

In the end, I'm still dreaming and hoping. What could be better than that.

==================================================================
I don't know why but random thoughts of death popped up into my head pretty often these days. I mean I'm perfectly fine I don't want to die, but also I keep wondering what kind of memories
I will leave behind when I die? What do I want to be remembered for? I guess that's what I want to find out and live up to. New year's resolution? Done.

It's time to let go of things. Surprisingly, I feel calm about it. Ajattelen sinua koko ajan, but also that's about what I'll do from this day onward.
From HIMYM -- “We’re going to get older, whether we like it or not, so the only question is whether we get on with our lives or desperately cling to the past.” 
I've chosen to look ahead, maybe I'm already on my way to discover something new.
