Books that I've recently enjoyed:
* The comfort book -- recommended by Siyan 
8 Tiny beautiful things -- a random find @Posman Bookstore 


Random quotes that I found beautiful 
1.  The future has an ancient heart
2.  let everything happen to you: beauty and terror, Just keep going, no feeling is final 
3.  To be complete in incompleteness
4.  We all fall apart to become new
5.  Only finite things can be measured, after all 
6.  Accepting that life connects pain to joy and joy to pain within the same breath
7.  We all come from randomness we exist out of uncertainty. Out of near impossibility. And yet we exist. So wehn you feel the odds are 
against you  it's important to realize that they 're never so against you when you didnt exist. And there you are, we are, existing.
