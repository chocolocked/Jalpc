2nd Ed Sheeran concert of the year, @Foxborough, Gillette Stadium.

The light dimmed, the crowd got quiet. This red hair guy was standing still striking the guitar, singing with his eyes closed. 
Everything else disappeared from this world, all that was left was his melody, my memories, and my thoughts. 

'''
We keep this love in a photograph

We made these memories for ourselves

Where our eyes are never closing

Hearts are never broken

And time's forever frozen, still
'''

We all have been there; loved and hurt, didn't love and hurt others. We are all imperfect human beings learning how to let go of past relationships,
learning to become better, and learning to trust and be open to another person with the possibility of getting hurt again. Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic deep down.  
“Love is totally nonsensical. But we have to keep doing it or else we’re lost and love is dead, and humanity should just pack it in. 
Because love is the best thing we do.”
One day I'll be getting married (I know that), and WE WILL be getting married to this song.

D and I were lying down in the car seats while waiting in a line to get out of the parking lot that seemed never moving and randomly chatting about
hopes and dreams. The moon was shining bright.
"I want to live in a wooden cottage house in a secluded forest with lots of books and still keep my writing habit when I'm 80. You know, maybe somewhere
in the NC countryside", she said. 
"Just you? Don't you want to be with somebody?", I asked, "I want to live somewhere near the water with lots of sunshine, with someone I love
and dog(s). And we can read, dance, sing, cook, and laugh all the time. I think I'll retire somewhere in Europe".

"What's your Hogwarts house?"
"Ravenclaw, yours?" I asked.
"Hufflepuff, I'm so surprised cuz I thought you would be a Gryffindor, cuz you're so ... brave". 
"I would like to be Gryffindor but Pottermore clearly decided I wasn't that brave enough. Maybe Pottermore is right".

We laughed.
