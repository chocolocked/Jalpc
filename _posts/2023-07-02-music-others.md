2nd Ed Sheeran concert of the year, @Foxborough, Gillette Stadium.

The light dimmed, the crowd got quiet. This red hair guy was standing still striking the guitar, singing with his eyes closed. 
Everything else disappeared from this world, all that was left was his melody, some memories, and my thoughts. 

'''
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

D and I were lying down in the car seats while waiting in a line to get out of the parking lot that seemed never moving and randomly chatting about
hopes and dreams. The moon was shining bright.
"I want to live in a wooden cottage house in a secluded forest with lots of books and still keep my writing habit when I'm 80. You know, maybe somewhere
in the NC countryside", she said. 
"Just you? Don't you want to be with somebody, your partner?", I asked, "I want to live somewhere near the water with lots of sunshine, with someone I love
and dog(s). And we can read, dance, sing, cook, and laugh all the time. I hope we could retire somewhere in Europe".

"What's your Hogwarts house, Ginny?" 
"Ravenclaw, yours?" 
"Hufflepuff, I thought you would be a Gryffindor, cuz you seem so ... brave/å‹‡". 
"I'd like to be a Gryffindor but Pottermore clearly decided I wasn't that brave enough. Maybe Pottermore is right".

We laughed. 
Maybe good things can happen after 2am, when you're with friends.
