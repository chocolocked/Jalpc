Listened to a podcast: "No Regrets: How to take risks in your communication, relationships and career"
and decided to take that leap of faith (I guess again, again and again). And it turned out a bit sad.
But who cares really, the answer must be in the attempt.

Moving onward, the next steps:

* Out of Boston (The city is affecting my mental health lol) to somewhere with water and lots of sunshine. 
* Doing a great job
* Let’s get some soul-searching. Don’t give in just yet.
* Getting ready for trips to San Diego & some old friends and new; DC & lots of dancing. 
* Let's make lots of money so that we can maybe open a bakery shop, and retire early somewhere in Europe ( ´∀｀)つt[ ]

While having this mediocre donut from Blackbird, it suddenly dawned on me: Blackbird donut is so quintessential Boston -- it looks fancy, and lots of people flock in just to have a taste, but for the price you pay, the quality you get is so mediocre, so astonishingly unsurprising. Blackbird in donuts is exactly like Boston in cities.
