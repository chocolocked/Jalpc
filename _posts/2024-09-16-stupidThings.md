Random thoughts rushing in since last night. I guess I never quite get over some things like I thought I did. 
Resurging of feelings, resurging of thoughts of what it could be between us. Stupid stupid emotions.

I thought you might be my Lebenslanger Schicksalsschatz, but I'm just delusional. Am I stupid or wise to hold on to the feelings? 

==============================================

"Much has passed between us, Or was it always on the one side? 
I am at fault at fault, I asked you to be human -- I am no needier than other people. But the absense of all feeling, of the least concern for me."
