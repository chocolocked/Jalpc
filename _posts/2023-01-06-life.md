I think for the most part, I'm a very content, positive, and carefree individual. However sometimes, random sadness does creep in. 
Today is because of a film and/or a poem
```
The world forgetting, by the world forgot/

Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!/

Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;
```

Welp.  Words fail me now.
