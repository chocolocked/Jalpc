This time last year, I got my Data Science summer offer from Novartis, knowing that I'll be working with awesome mentors on exicting medical image preditive analytics.

Well, now this year, I've got something even bigger waiting for me on the next chapter after graduation. Can't express how excited and how grateful I'm for everything 
along this journey. 

Let's end this random blog with some of my favorite quotes, again.
From last time: 
**Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.**
And 
**I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, life gives it to you.**

May you have what you want, and may peace prevail on earth.
