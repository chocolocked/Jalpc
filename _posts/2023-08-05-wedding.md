Was at a wedding.

The newlyweds (S & S) were so happy and so in love. The way they looked at each other and all the quirky little details revealed during the shoe game were just, so so cute.

The couple joined the dancing crowd and tried out their newly learned moves -- just adorable. And I danced my feet off with some stranger on the dance floor.

Weddings are fun, as I was repeatedly reminded. So if I ever get married, I want to get so very married, and our wedding dance is gonna be epic.
