Updated my phone, and for a brief moment all my imsgs were gone after the date of April 21.
I was in total shock and didn't know what to do but stared at the conversation for two whole minutes.
Desperately closed all my apps, restarted my phone, and wished for a miracle, finally there they were, all the msgs were back in the conversation. 
All the silly jokes. 

Lost my cool in those two minutes. I guess there is something you can't hide.
