Why do people always mistake friendly gestures as interests? Argh! ArghÔºÅArgh!

Sorry but no, my mind, my feelings, and my eyes are so hopelessly, irretrievably and unfortunately occupied since May. It's a bit sad, very silly, but makes me very happy. Maybe it will change tmr, maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe next year, maybe never.
